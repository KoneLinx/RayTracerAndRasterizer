# Graphics programming projects

These are my projects made during my graphics programming course.

It includes a software ray tracer, software rasteriser and directx rasteriser. The latter two are combinded into a single programme.

## Ray tracer

A ray tracer written in C++. For educational purposes it was written from scratch, singlethreaded and on the cpu only. It makes use of SDL to handle draw buffer swapping only.

## Rasteriser

Much alike the ray tracer: written in C++ from scratch and singlehtrheaded.

This rasteriser is combined with the DirectX rasteriser. Use R to switch dynamically when the programme is running.

## Rasteriser (DirectX)

A rasteriser having DirectX do the rendering using simple shaders we wrote. Obvioulsy performing much better than my software rasteriser.

## Shaders (Not included)

In a thrird party rasteriser we also implmented several shaders and other common techniques. These include shadow mapping, animations, transparancy and collisions.
